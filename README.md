# JavaScript-Quiz
A short, fun quiz made with JavaScript

## Description

I completely revamped this JavaScript quiz. There are still some bugs, but the overall functionality is much better. I could not, however, find the bug to get the answer to display so the user currently see a list of three incorrect responses. In the interest of time, I decided to submit the project as is. 

Here is a link to the site: https://sinclairems.github.io/JavaScript-Quiz/

Here's what it will look like on the desktop:
