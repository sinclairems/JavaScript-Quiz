# JavaScript-Quiz
A short, fun quiz made with JavaScript

## Description

This quiz kicked my butt. I focused too much on the styling and not enough on the JavaScript, so there are some bugs! 
The JavaScript cycles nicely through the questions. There is a timer. And the score is shown at the end of the quiz. However, the quiz does not deduct points for running out of time (although my grader for this assignment will!), nor does it allow the user to insert and store their initials in local storage. If I had a chance to do this assignment over, I would focus first on the basics: complete assignment requirements. After that, I would use spare time to make it pretty. 

In this assignment, I really saw how easy it is to get lost in your own code! I tried to go back and add the timer function, but I couldn't remember how the logic applied. I spent a long time working, and reworking, and messing things up, but it was a good learning experience.
